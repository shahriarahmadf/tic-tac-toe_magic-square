# tic-tac-toe_magic-square
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game coded on the basis of magic square of three to find the winner

Making the tic-tac-toe becomes a little complicated when it comes to finding the winner.

So, in this small project, I have implemented an easy way to find the winner.

It is by using the magic square of 3, where magic number = 15, meaning- sum of any three numbers in the magic square matrix is three either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. By using these values corresponding to the positions of move in the game board, we can easily find the winner of the game.
